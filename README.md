# AR_Stickers
This AR apps shows a gallery of objects that can be placed, or anchored in the augmented world. Then take a photo of the AR scene and save it to Photos.

Sceneform provides the high level API for rendering 3D models using Java. This dramatically increases the velocity that developers can create AR experiences. This codelab introduces some of the Sceneform API.

The key features are:

Adding the Sceneform fragment to an Android application for easily handling ARCore session creation and common UX elements.
A node based scene graph for placing multiple objects in the same scene.
Importing 3D models into your Android Studio project
Handling interactions to place and move objects in the AR scene.
Taking a picture of your AR experience.
Prerequisites
Make sure you have these before starting the codelab:

Android Studio 3.1 or greater
ARCore compatible device and USB cable
Access to the internet to download libraries during building.
